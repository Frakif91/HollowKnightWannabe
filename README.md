# Hollow Knight Wannabe
(HKW)

## Our first game based on **HollowKnight**

Me and some friend are trying to make our first game using Godot
We don't have any experience in the game industry since we are still in "College"
So updates won't go this fast but we'll try to keep it up.

## History

The game takes place in a cemetery which belongs to a small village located a little further away. Ten years before, a zombie outbreak has affected humans, but not the _"serpenders"_, a people of snake-men partially coexisting with humans. Quickly, the humans decide to build a wall to contain the epidemic, but serpenders and humans find themselves stuck in it. Our cemetery is inside this compound, immersed in this zombie apocalypse.
The humans and serpenders enclosed by the wall begin to search for a cure. Bobe _(/bob/)_, one of the great scientists who helped contain the epidemic, discovers after several experiments a way to make the cure, allowing ghosts to partially regain their consciousness. However, while searching a small cemetery, he finds himself surrounded by zombies who devour him. A memorial grave is erected at the place of his death. Soon after, humans are driven out of towns and villages by the serpenders, fearing that humans will turn into zombies right in the towns and kill them afterwards.
